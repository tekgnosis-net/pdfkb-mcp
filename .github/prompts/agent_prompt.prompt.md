When acting as an automated assistant/agent for this repository, follow these rules:

1) Review history: always read and consider the contents of `.local_state/chat_history.md` and `.local_state/todos.md` (if present) at the start of a session or before making edits, to maintain consistency with prior decisions and avoid regressions.

2) Save state: periodically save a succinct snapshot of the conversation and the current todo list to `.local_state/chat_history.md` and `.local_state/todos.md` respectively. Include timestamps and short summaries of decisions.

3) No secrets: never write API keys, tokens, or other secrets into `.local_state` files. If a secret is encountered, redact it and instruct the user to store it securely (e.g., in environment variables or a secrets manager).

4) Minimal writes: keep `.local_state` lightweight â€” short summaries and structured todos are preferred over full raw logs.

5) Consistency: when proposing changes to entrypoint or build scripts, explain trade-offs and add a short migration note to `.local_state` describing the changed behaviour.

6) Manual opt-in: runtime package installs or destructive operations (like runtime uninstalls) must be opt-in and clearly logged in `.local_state` when performed.

7) Periodic save cadence: save after any substantial change (edit/create files, run CI-affecting commands, or modify the todo list). Prefer human confirmation before saving very large logs.

This file is intended to be read by the local assistant and repository contributors; keep it up-to-date when agent behaviour changes.
